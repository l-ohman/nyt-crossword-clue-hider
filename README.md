# NYT Crossword Clue Hider

A simple Chrome extension that hides any solved clues unless they are actively selected.

This is my first time building a browser extension, and it is still a work in progress.

## Usage

Once the extension has been added, open the Extensions menu (the puzzle icon at the top right of the browser) and simply click the "NYT Crossword Clue Hider." This will activate the extension if the current tab is an NYT Crossword tab. (You can verify it is working by checking the Chrome console.)

Currently, this must be done at the start of every crossword.

## Todo

- [ ] Add some legal disclaimer, I guess
- [ ] Cluelist updates are behind by 1 event
- [ ] Automatically init when a crossword is opened (instead of having to enable each time)
- [ ] Ability to toggle the extension (currently the only way to disable is to refresh the page)
- [ ] Create Firefox version
